Stack Used:
FrontEnd: React, BootStrap 
BackEnd: Python Flask (I would have preferred Django, but it was Restricted)
Image Storage: Amazon S3
Data Storage: SQLite(with ORM SQLAlchemy)

APIs:
Upload API
Search API
Amazon Rekognition API( for getting tags)

Challenges Faced:
Permissions for all Amazon related things like (S3 Storage, Rekognition API).
Working for first time in React(due to which assignment gets delayed)
Dealing with different aspect ratio.

Thought of using but not implemented:
Presigned Url(giving image Permissions for some period of time).
Amazon RDS for data Storage for Scaling.
Refresing page when Upload image takes place.

What I Learn:
Learn a lot about React
How to use SQLAlchemy
About CORS
IAM Roles(AWS)
How to use Amazon S3 bucket, Rekognition API
Presigned Url.
